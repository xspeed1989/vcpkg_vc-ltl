vulkan is compatible with built-in CMake targets:

    # https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindVulkan.html
    find_package(Vulkan REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE Vulkan::Vulkan)

The vulkan package does not provide direct Visual Studio integration.
For manual integration, add $(VULKAN_SDK)/include to your include path.
